Hello and thank you for being interested in my blog! In this blog I hope to explore many different topics that I am passionate about such as smart home devices, website design, electronics, and many others.

If you have ideas on new topics I should cover please send me an email via my <a href="http://theinternet.onthewifi.com/contact">contact section.</a> 

I will slowly be adding new blog posts over the begining of 2018, please bare with me as it will be slow going. After the begining as I am calling it I hope to do at least one blog post per week. I will also be documenting any new projects I acomplish on my landing <a href="http://theinternet.onthewifi.com/#portfolio">page</a>. 

Once again welcome and thank you for being a Blog follower!
