# Homebrewing 101

Who doesn't love a good craft beer? If you don't this article probably isnt for you. However if you do and you always wondered how to make your own brew, your in luck. This article is going to go over how to brew from a kit, using specialty grains, liquid malt extract (LME), and dry malt extract (DME).

## Background

I have been brewing for a few years now, more activly in the past 6 months. I love to brew! There is nothing more satisfying than drinking a delicious beer you made yourself. When I first started I had little to no knowledge and just kinda brewed by the seat of my pants. I later took a class and then began to read books and brew more. This article does not go into the advanced topics of recipie design, it is simply how do i make my first batch. 

## Brewing Supplies

There are a few specialy items you will need for your first batch but most are things you might already have. I recomend if you plan to brew alot buying brewing only equipment. What I mean by this is, do not use the same pot for making your brew as your famous pasta sause, or chicken stock. Even with a good clean it is best to keep these cooking activities seperate. 

### Sanitizer

Everyone has their own opinions here, and you can use alot of different things. I personally use Sanstar because its cheep easy, and no rinse. 

* Based on my knowledge and reading contless books and foam produced from this in your car boy can stay as it does not make off flavors in your beer.

### Books

Books are not a necessity but if your really looking to go at this, a book is a good place to get some great information.

#### Boil Equipment

+ Five gallon pot
+ Lid for pot
+ Wodden spoon 

Optional equipment

+ Hop strainer metal or bag

#### Fermentation Equipment

+ Glass Carboy with rubber stopper or Plastic Fermentation Bucket with airlock lid
+ Airlock or Bubbler

#### Bottling Equipment

+ Bottles - At least 48 for a 5 gallon batch
+ Caps
+ Capper

#### Other specilized equipment

+ Wort chiller
+ Themometer
+ Hydrometer

#### Brew kit

The kits I use generally come from a local brew supply shop. They include everything you need. Listed below are what most usually have in them.

+ Specialty Grains
+ Liquid Malt Exstract (LME)
+ Dry Malt Exstract (DME)
+ Hops 
+ Irish Moss
+ Dry Yeast
+ Steeping Sock
+ Carbination Sugar - Used for bottling

## Getting started

### 1. Steep Specialty Grains

So I'll assume you have everything mentioned above and are readay to brew. You will want to follow your recipie that came with your kit but most beers will follow a standard procedure I will explain below. 

First you will want to bring 2 gallons of declorinated water to about 150 degrees F. Once at temp you will add your specialty grains into a steaping sock and start steeping your grains. You will want to saturate them and adgitate them for about20 min. Time will change depending on your beer and grains. 

### 2. Boil

You will then add another 1-2 gallons of decholrinated water to the kettle and bring this mixture called wort to a boil. Once you reach a boil you will add your LME and DME from your kit. After this addition bring back to a boil. Once again at a boil add your bittering hops, once added you will boil for either 45 minutes to an hour, depending on your brew. During this time called the Boil you will add other aditions of hops for flavor and arroma. Depending on your brew you might add other things such as spices and other ingrediants. Usually 15 minutes before the end of the boil you will add in your irish moss.

<b><u>Recomendations and Tips</u></b>

If using a wart chiller add it to the boil about 15min from the end, this will allow it to sanitize in the boil. I highly recommend a wart chiller as it highly excelerates the colling process.

If brewing a hoppy beer such as an IPA, use a hop strainer or hop bag with a fine mesh. This will not only help in the future when transfering your beer into your primary fermentor (nothing lumpy to clog your scifin) if will make it easier to get a clearer beer when bottling.

### 3. Chill

As mentioned above i recommend a wort chiller. I did not have one of these for my first two batches and it probably took 2-3 hours to cool in the sink. Once I got a wort chiller, this time was 20-30 minutes. If saving $40 is worth a few hours every brew to you save it! Otherwise I HIGHLY recommend this. Either way you will need to chill your beer if this is by running water through your wort chiller or placing your pot in a sink of ice water and changing it about ever 20-30 min untill you reach a wort temperature of about 80 degrees F. Once your wort is chilled, you will want to move it to your primary fermentor. This can be either plastic or glass. I perfer glass car boys for primary and plastic for secondary. 

The reason I say this is not because I perfer glass to plastic 9 times out of 10. It is because your primary fermentor will require a lot more cleaning than your secondary, because of the yeast making foam which sticks. Yes glass car boys are generally harder to clean but with the right scrubber, technique, and elbow gresse, it becomes a perfectly smooth clean surface. If you use plastic, the more scrubbing and abbrasions the more scrached it will become. If it is scrached heavily replace it! 

This is because it can harber bacteria in those small scratches and you might not kill them when sanitizing. 

### 4. Primary Fermentation

### 5. Ferment

### 6. Secondary Fermentaion

<b>SANITIZE ANYTHING USED IN THIS STEP!!!</b>

USe your sciphon to transfer your beer from your primary fermentor to your secondary fermentor (this would be where youd dry hop if included in your kit). Make sure to leave your yeast cake as i call it in the bottom of your primary fermentor. The less particals you move now the clearer your beer will be later.

### 7. Bottle

<b>SANITIZE YOUR BOTTLES, CAPS, TUBING, and BOTTLING WAND</b>

### 8. Condition

### 9. Chill again

Put your carbinated brews in the fridge to cool down, I usually do this for at least 24 hours. This cold breaks the yeast and makes the beer cold and tasty!

### 9. Drink!

Enjoy your home brew! I like to drink out of a pint glass, probably one from a brewery! 

<b>Note:</b>  Since this is a home brew and not a professionally filter beer there may be yeast in the beer, i usually do not drink the last little bit of my brew, because of this.
