# Build your Own Cluster
To start I will explain my setup and you can modify it however you need to fit your setup.

I have 5 Raspberry Pis and a Pine 64. The Pine 64 is running Open Media Vault and is currently acting as a NAS device. 
> I will be upgrading it to a Nanopi M4v2 in the near future and creating to best DIY NAS you've ever seen. Stay tuned.
