# Build your Own Cluster
Like me you might have several raspberry pi or other SBC's set up in your house for various tasks. I had a Plex, Home-Assistant, Pi-Hole, and a Node.js server running on 4 separate raspberry pis and wanted to upgrade my system. It seems like a hard task but I found the perfect solution Kubernetes. I was familiar with the idea of running containerized applications as I had Home-Assistant and Pi-Hole running in docker containers on my Pine64 already but never heard of Kubernetes.

# So what is Kubernetes?

# Kubernetes vs Docker

# Why use it?
