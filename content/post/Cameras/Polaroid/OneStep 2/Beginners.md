# Something New and Something Old.

This is probably the greatest thing to happen to instant film since the [Impossible Project](https://us.polaroidoriginals.com/pages/about-us). A new camera with new integrated features, and the same great old school look we love from the original One Step. I recently bought a [One Step 2](https://us.polaroidoriginals.com/products/onestep2-polaroid-camera?variant=971188568090), first to support Polaroid Originals as a company and movement and secondly because it is awesome! It is great at taking photos with less waste than other instant films, since it has a built in rechargable battery. This will be the camera that revives instant film!

## Why Instant Film? Why Not Just Instant?

I once heard someone talk about instant film and how it is a tangible memory, it is great at taking you back to that time and place of the photo. Unlike digital, you take a few instant film shots and your remember them. With digital you take thousands and thousands of pictures that you bearly look at and they take up hard drive space. Where a few Polaroid instant film photos in a box can transport you anywhere.

## Should You Get One?

Well ultimently this is a question you have to answer yourself, I can guide you and I definitely recommend one but its always your choice. But ask yourself these questions:

+ Do you want to make your memories even more memorable?
+ Do you want to be the hit of the party?
+ Do you want a collection of timeless photos?
+ Are you new to instant film?
+ Are you expierenced with instant film?
+ Do you love Polaroids?

If you said yes to any of these questions or thought "Hmmm that sounds cool." then I say you should get one. It is a new way to take photos even for those of us that have been taking 600 film shots for years, or decades. 

## Things you might need:

### One Step 2

Obviously you will the need the camera to shoot with. If you have an old polaroid you could start there, see my other blog post on [Different Types of Polaroids(/DifferentTypesOfPolaroids)].

## Accessories.

A good tripod is nice to help you get in your own photos. The timer and flash are built into the camera so you wont need one of those. Maybe a carring case, I personally like this [one](https://us.polaroidoriginals.com/products/box-camera-bag-white).

##### *I've yet to have a perfect centered photo. I assume this is because I have yet to take the photo. My brother in photo 1 was completely cropped off :( .
