# The New OneStep 2

So it has finally happened! A new Polaroid Camera!! This is an exciting time! If you are a fan of analog photos this is a tall tale sign that they are here to stay.

## My OneStep 2

Since the release of the OneStep 2 I have wanted one bably! So I finally purchased one a few weeks back. I was hopeful someone would of gifted it to me over the holidays but no luck. I purchased my OneStep 2 from Ebay because I had a coupon and it came with two boxes of film! Find a deal always!! You can look in my [beginners guide](../beginners) for more buying information. 

### Packaging
The one step 2 comes in a great solid box that is designed to fit the camera, strap and charging cable perfectly with no room to spare. I like this design because it means there is less wasted materials.
