# Polaroid 80 Years of Cameras

## Pack Film

### -Land Cameras 100-400 Series

## Integral Film

Integral FIlm is very different from pack film since the positive and negative are incorperated into one photo. This eliminates the need to pull the photo apart after a minute of fixing or so. Removes all needed skill in the development cycle.

### -SX-70

### -600

### -Spectra

## Zink FIlm
